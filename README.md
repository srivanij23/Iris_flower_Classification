# ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification

This project develops a machine learning model to classify **Iris flower species** based on petal and sepal dimensions. The model identifies among **three species**:
- Iris-setosa
- Iris-versicolor
- Iris-virginica

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Build a classifier for Iris species
- Identify most important features affecting classification
- Evaluate multiple ML models and compare their accuracy
- Visualize data relationships and model performance

---

## ðŸ“Š Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains 150 samples, each with four features: 
- Sepal length (cm)
- Sepal width (cm)
- Petal length (cm)
- Petal width (cm)

Each sample is labeled with one of the three Iris species, providing a balanced representation for training and evaluation.

## ðŸ”§ Tools and Libraries
- Python
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## ðŸ“ˆ EDA and Feature Analysis

- Histograms and scatter plots for visual distribution  
- Correlation matrix using `seaborn` heatmap  
- Feature importance using `SelectKBest` with `mutual_info_classif`

---

## ðŸ§  Models Used

- Logistic Regression  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Decision Tree Classifier

Each model was evaluated using:
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

Best accuracy achieved: **~100% with KNN**
